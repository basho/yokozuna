  <!-- IndexReaderFactory

       Use the following format to specify a custom IndexReaderFactory,

       ** Experimental Feature **

       Please note - Using a custom IndexReaderFactory may prevent
       certain other features from working. The API to
       IndexReaderFactory may change without warning or may even be
       removed from future releases if the problems cannot be
       resolved.


       ** Features that may not work with custom IndexReaderFactory **

       The ReplicationHandler assumes a disk-resident index. Using a
       custom IndexReader implementation may cause incompatibility
       with ReplicationHandler and may cause replication to not work
       correctly. See SOLR-1366 for details.

         FastLRUCache, based on a ConcurrentHashMap.

         FastLRUCache has faster gets and slower puts in single
         threaded operation and thus is generally faster than LRUCache
         when the hit ratio of the cache is high (> 75%), and may be

    <!-- Filter Cache

         Cache used by SolrIndexSearcher for filters (DocSets),

         "autowarmed" using data from caches in the old searcher.
         autowarmCount is the number of items to prepopulate.  For
         LRUCache, the autowarmed items will be the most recently
         accessed items.

  <!-- Request Dispatcher

       This section contains instructions for how the SolrDispatchFilter

       handleSelect is a legacy option that affects the behavior of requests

       handleSelect="true" will cause the SolrDispatchFilter to process
       the request and dispatch the query to a handler specified by the
       "qt" param, assuming "/select" isn't already registered.

       handleSelect="false" will cause the SolrDispatchFilter to
       ignore "/select" requests, resulting in a 404 unless a handler
       is explicitly registered with the name "/select"

       handleSelect="true" is not recommended for new users, but is the default

         you want the value to exactly correspond to when the physical
         index was last modified.

         etagSeed="..." is an option you can change to force the ETag
         header (and validation against If-None-Match requests) to be
         different even if the index has not changed (ie: when making
         significant changes to your config file)

  <!-- Field Analysis Request Handler

       RequestHandler that provides much the same functionality as
       analysis.jsp. Provides the ability to specify multiple field
       types and field names in the same request and outputs
       index-time and query-time analysis for each of them.

       Request parameters are:
       analysis.fieldname - field name whose analyzers are to be used

       analysis.fieldtype - field type whose analyzers are to be used
       analysis.fieldvalue - text for index-time analysis
       q (or analysis.q) - text for query time analysis
       analysis.showmatch (true|false) - When set to true and when
           query analysis is performed, the produced tokens of the
           field value analysis will be marked as "matched" for every
           token that is produces by the query analysis
   -->

  <!-- Document Analysis Handler

       http://wiki.apache.org/solr/AnalysisRequestHandler

       An analysis handler that provides a breakdown of the analysis
       process of provided documents. This handler expects a (single)
       content stream with the following format:

       <docs>
         <doc>
           <field name="id">1</field>
           <field name="name">The Name</field>
           <field name="text">The Text Value</field>
         </doc>
         <doc>...</doc>
         <doc>...</doc>
         ...
       </docs>

    Note: Each document must contain a field which serves as the
    unique key. This key is used in the returned response to associate
    an analysis breakdown to the analyzed document.

    Like the FieldAnalysisRequestHandler, this handler also supports
    query analysis by sending either an "analysis.query" or "q"
    request parameter that holds the query text to be analyzed. It
    also supports the "analysis.showmatch" parameter which when set to
    true, all field tokens that match the query tokens will be marked
    as a "match".
